# 🛣️ Road Accident Survival Rate Analysis

Welcome to the **Road Accident Survival Rate Analysis** project!  
This analysis explores factors that affect the survival chances of road accident victims, with a specific focus on **helmet and seatbelt usage**.  
The project was carried out in **Excel** using a dataset of **198 road accident records**.

---

## 🚗 Project Background

This project analyzes data from a study on **road accidents**, aiming to understand how various factors such as **speed of impact, age, gender, and safety gear usage** influence survival outcomes.

The goal is to **increase road accident survival rates** by providing actionable insights to stakeholders — including **traffic authorities, public health officials, and motorists** — on the importance of consistent helmet and seatbelt use.

**Insights and recommendations** are provided on the following key areas:
- **Category 1:** Speed of Impact
- **Category 2:** Safety Gear (Helmet + Seatbelt)
- **Category 3:** Age Category
- **Category 4:** Gender

## 🧾 Data Structure & Initial Checks

The dataset consists of **one main table** containing **198 records**, with each row representing a single road accident case.

**Key columns:**
- **Age** — Age of the accident victim  
- **Gender** — Male or Female  
- **Helmet** — Whether the victim was wearing a helmet  
- **Seatbelt** — Whether the victim was wearing a seatbelt  
- **Survived** — Survival status of the victim (Yes/No)  
- **Speed of Impact** — Classified as Low, Medium, or High  
- **Age Category** — Grouped as Young (<35 years) and Old (≥36 years)

**Data Relationship:** Each record represents one individual involved in a road accident, containing their demographic information, protective gear status, and survival outcome.

**Visualizations created in Excel include:**
- Doughnut charts (survival rate overview)  
- Pie chart (helmet + seatbelt usage vs survival)  
- Bar & stacked bar charts (gender and age comparisons)  
- 2D line graphs (relationship between helmet + seatbelt use and survival probability)

## 🧠 Insights Deep Dive

### **Category 1: Speed of Impact**

* **Main insight 1:** Accidents involving **high-speed impacts** recorded the **highest survival rate (53.25%)**, compared to medium-speed (51.25%) and low-speed (45%) impacts.  
* **Main insight 2:** **Speed alone was not the main determinant** of survival; protective gear usage played a key role.  
* **Main insight 3:** Victims in lower-speed impacts often **neglected safety measures**, contributing to lower survival rates.  
* **Main insight 4:** **Safety equipment has a stronger influence** on survival than speed alone.

### **Category 2: Safety Gear (Helmet + Seatbelt)**

* **Main insight 1:** Victims wearing **both a helmet and seatbelt** had the **highest survival rate** of all categories.  
* **Main insight 2:** Those who wore only one type of gear had **moderate survival rates**, while those without any gear had the **lowest**.  
* **Main insight 3:** **Combined use of safety gear** offers the best protection.  
* **Main insight 4:** Lack of compliance correlated with **higher fatality rates**, emphasizing the need for public safety awareness.

### **Category 3: Age Category**

* **Main insight 1:** Individuals aged **36 years and above** had a **higher survival rate** compared to younger victims.  
* **Main insight 2:** Younger individuals (<35) may engage in **riskier driving behaviors** and show less adherence to safety protocols.  
* **Main insight 3:** Older individuals tend to **wear helmets and seatbelts more consistently**, leading to better outcomes.  
* **Main insight 4:** Experience and caution appear to **positively influence** survival chances.

### **Category 4: Gender**

* **Main insight 1:** **Male participants** recorded a **higher survival rate** compared to females.  
* **Main insight 2:** This may be linked to **differences in safety gear usage or exposure patterns** between genders.  
* **Main insight 3:** Males showed **slightly higher compliance** with helmet and seatbelt use.  
* **Main insight 4:** Targeted safety campaigns for **female road users** could help bridge this survival gap.

## 🧩 Recommendations

Based on the findings, the following actions are recommended:

* **Promote dual protective gear use** — Wearing both a helmet and seatbelt significantly increases survival chances.  
* **Intensify road safety education** — Especially targeting younger drivers and riders who show lower compliance.  
* **Enforce strict safety laws** — Authorities should ensure adherence to helmet and seatbelt regulations.  
* **Design targeted campaigns** — Focus on female and younger demographics to increase safety awareness.  
* **Encourage defensive driving training** — Particularly for high-speed environments.

## ⚙️ Assumptions and Caveats

* Missing records were assumed to represent **complete cases**.  
* Some values in the “Speed of Impact” column were **grouped manually** into Low, Medium, and High.  
* The dataset covered **198 cases**, which may not represent all accident types or regions.  
* The analysis assumes that **helmet and seatbelt variables were recorded accurately**.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates that **safety behavior — not just accident speed — determines survival outcomes**.  
Encouraging consistent use of **helmets and seatbelts**, along with targeted awareness campaigns, can greatly improve survival rates in road accidents.
